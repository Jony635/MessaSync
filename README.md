# MessaSync

MessaSync is a chatroom-based Android app when everybody can see and join all the rooms, which can be protected with a password.
At the moment, only the admin user can create and modify the rooms, although everyone can send messages into them if they can join in.

This app is being developed for educational/entertainment purposes. It lacks security and the data is not encripted in the Cloud Firestore Database, so if you want to test it for curiosity do it, but ensure to control what you send to the chat.
